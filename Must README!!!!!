# AVP
Many people use cheating in AVP games and find that no matter which cheating is used, it will crash. This is the problem.
But recently I found that this is because the single player mode has also added anti cheating, so every time the game detects cheating, the game will automatically crash
Don't worry, I have a cheating device that won't cause the game to crash
The second option for this cheater is â€œDisable Anticheats".When we enable this option, cheating will never crash again
